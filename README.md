# Plant.it Project Submission

Plant.it is a community driven web application which allows people to get together and help our environment. With COVID restrictions being slowly lifted in the next few months, this app is meant to encourage people to meet up and do something good for the future of our communities. This app allows people to create a "Planting Party", this can be joined by other people in the area who want to help in the endeavor. Joining in on these parties or creating one when you find a piece of land that could use a bit more green rewards you with points. These points would be able to be used to redeem gift cards from various sponsors of our program.

Plant.it is a dynamic react web app which utilizes and builds upon the Material-UI design guidelines. The backend of this web app utilizes Express (Node.js), MongoDB, and Azure Blob Storage. These systems working together allow us to provide a seamless experience for the end user.
